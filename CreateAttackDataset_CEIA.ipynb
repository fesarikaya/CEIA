    "This novel adversarial attack method that I have developed is called <b>CEIA (Contextual Embedding Inversion Attack)</b>. This method is a sophisticated and novel approach to creating adversarial examples for BERT-based models, particularly targeting question-answering systems.<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEIA method is a novel and sophisticated adversarial attack that challenges BERT-based question-answering systems in several ways:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Semantic Inversion:</b> By finding and applying antonym phrases, it alters the meaning of parts of the context and questions without making them grammatically incorrect or obviously altered.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Contextual Understanding Exploitation:</b> CEIA leverages BERT's own contextual embeddings to create adversarial examples, making it particularly effective against BERT-based models.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Preservation of Key Information:</b> By keeping answer phrases intact, it ensures that the questions remain answerable but requires models to navigate through potentially contradictory information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Noun Chunk Targeting:</b> The attack focusses on inverting noun chunks, which are often the most informative parts of a sentence, making the attack more impactful.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Robustness Testing:</b> This method effectively tests the robustness of QA models against subtle semantic changes in both context and questions.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEIA method represents a significant advancement in the field of adversarial attacks on NLP systems. It creates adversarial examples that are semantically coherent but potentially misleading, while preserving grammatical structure. This makes the attack particularly challenging to detect and defend against.<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach I have developed could be valuable for improving the robustness and reliability of question-answering systems in real-world applications where input texts might contain contradictions or inconsistencies. It also highlights the importance of developing more robust NLP models that can handle semantic inversions and contextual contradictions."
